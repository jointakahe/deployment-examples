# Docker Compose Example

This is the simplest way to get started with Takahe.

## Quick Start

1. Install [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/) and [Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/) on your platform
2. Copy the `docker-compose.example.yml` provider here and rename it as `docker-compose.yml`
3. Update the environment variables as described in [Takahe's documentation](https://docs.jointakahe.org/en/latest/installation/#environment-variables)
4. Run `docker compose up -d` to run everything.
